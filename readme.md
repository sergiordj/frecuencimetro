This folder have a button-based frequency meter.

Deginged for EDU-CIAA, this frequecy meter calculates pulse frequency of TEC 1 with "anti bounding" function adjusted to 40ms. 

The sampling frequency is 1kHz and have a sampling window of 2seconds.

Every 2 seconds, this meter sends calculated frequency by UART porration 115200 bauds per second, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit and parity none.
